# Unsupervised Monolingual Word Alignment
Analysis of unsupervised neural methods for monolingual word alignment. Based on [SimAlign](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08728), we designed several monolingual word alignment methods.

### Data: 
* MultiMWA-Benchmark: a manually annotated benchmark, Multi-Genre Monolingual Word Alignment (MultiMWA) proposed by [Lan et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02569).

### Model:
* SimAlign: high quality unsupervised word alignment model without parallel training data using static and contextualized embeddings, which was proposed by [Sabet et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08728).
